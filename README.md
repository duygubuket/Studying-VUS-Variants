# ðŸ§¬ SjÃ¶gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) VUS Analysis

This project investigates **variants of unknown significance (VUS)** in the **ALDH3A2 gene**, which is associated with **SjÃ¶gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS)**â€”a rare autosomal recessive neurocutaneous disorder. The analysis combines **evolutionary biology**, **phylogenetics**, and **bioinformatics tools** to assess the likelihood of these VUS being pathogenic or benign.

## ðŸ“š Introduction

SjÃ¶gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) is a rare genetic condition first described in Sweden in 1957. It affects **muscle tone**, **skin**, **retinal pigmentation**, and **intellectual development**, caused by **mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene** on chromosome 17. This gene encodes the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) enzyme.

This project focuses on the **evolutionary history of ALDH3A2** and characterization of **variants of uncertain significance (VUS)** using **phylogenetic trees**, **sequence alignment**, and **SIFT scores**.

## ðŸ”¬ Objective

- Analyze ALDH3A2 orthologs and paralogs
- Visualize evolutionary relationships with **Maximum Likelihood trees**
- Assess the **tolerability** of VUS based on amino acid conservation and phylogenetic distance
- Interpret functional consequences using **SIFT** and amino acid frequency analysis

## ðŸ§ª Tools & Methodology

- **Databases**:
  - [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000072210)
  - [NCBI BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
  - [LOVD ALDH3A2](https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/ALDH3A2)
  - NORD Rare Diseases

- **Software & Libraries**:
  - MEGA11 (Muscle, Maximum Likelihood Trees, Bootstrapping)
  - Python (sequence mutation recreation, FASTA processing)
  - SIFT (tolerability predictions)
  - FigTree (rerooting and visualizing NJ trees)
  - Pylab (visual analysis)

- **Approach**:
  - Download orthologous and paralogous sequences of ALDH3A2
  - Perform multiple sequence alignments
  - Construct phylogenetic trees using MEGA11
  - Analyze amino acid frequencies and tolerance scores
  - Evaluate VUS using tree positioning and SIFT scores

- **VUS Interpretation**:
  - Variants close to mammalian lineages = more tolerable
  - Distant sequences (e.g., yellow color in rerooted tree) suggest intolerant or deleterious variants

- **Tables**:
  - **Table 1**: Amino acid frequency per position
  - **Table 2**: Tolerance scores of each VUS

> Example Insight: A VUS at position 339 (I â†’ V) may be tolerable; while the same change at position 352 is less clear and requires further validation.
